        <h1>Guide to Space Invaders</h1>
        <p>
            Space Invaders is a classic arcade game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado and released in 1978.
            It is one of the earliest and most influential shooting games, where the player controls a laser cannon 
            and must defend Earth from waves of descending alien invaders. The game is known for its increasing difficulty 
            and strategic gameplay.
        </p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of Space Invaders is to destroy all the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen.
            The player must dodge enemy fire and carefully shoot down the invaders while using barriers for protection.
        </p>

        <h2>Gameplay Rules</h2>
        <p>
            The player moves the laser cannon left and right at the bottom of the screen and fires upward at the aliens.
            The game includes several mechanics that affect how the player must strategize:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Aliens move horizontally across the screen and descend gradually after hitting a screen edge.
            </li>
            <li>
                The pace of alien movement increases as their numbers decrease.
            </li>
            <li>
                Aliens fire projectiles downward; if the player is hit, a life is lost.
            </li>
            <li>
                Barriers provide cover but can be damaged by both enemy and player fire.
            </li>
            <li>
                Occasionally, a bonus UFO appears at the top of the screen and can be shot for extra points.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>
            The game typically uses simple controls:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Arrow keys:</strong> Move the cannon left or right.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Spacebar:</strong> Fire a shot.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>
            Points are earned by destroying enemies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Basic alien: 10 to 30 points depending on type.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bonus UFO: 50 to 300 points (varies per game version).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The game ends when the player loses all lives or the aliens reach the bottom of the screen.
        </p>
