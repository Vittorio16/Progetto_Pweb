cambiare animazione giocatore tra nuova wave e vita persa? 

keep track of bullets shot, enemies killed and game time in order to perform server side controls (su gpt, canvas restart issues)
Could also cheat with infinite lives or by stopping collision check or stopping enemies or infinite lives....
Tie a game with game id, and don't save data if multiple games are in progress (so if timestamp is less than current time)
Need to save starting datetime on save_score.php

forse audio output
add exit button on the left on guid
reset bullets between waves
Could do game statistics

Riattivare autoupdate chrome


Fatto:
Clearare campi di login/input
Sistemato GAME OVER quando Login
button to quit game (not saving score) - change start button to quit button when game active -- remove event listeners on keys
create wave number and timeout between waves
