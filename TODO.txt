Could cheat by spawning infinite drops

Tell player that faster ufos are worth more
If power up already present of the same time, prolong duration
Check if handlers are all right with content maybe not loaded
Add waves to statistics
Fix schermo che scorre con spacebar
Check what happens when screen shrinks vertically
Collisions should use dynamic widths


It seems to handle multiple games at the same time by the same player well -- make session unique per user across different browsers
High score doesn't update if a game is finished in another tab
Can still always cheat by simulating a whole game
Could cheat by stopping collision check on player
Can't really check game_start and game_end, might not have loaded yet
Still ways to cheat, especially if slightly

Riattivare autoupdate chrome



Fatto:
Quando play game chiudi sidebar
aggiungere messaggio in mancato login/signup via serverside
Unfocus all buttons after clickig (so that pressing space doesn't reclick them)



const score = 1000000;
const gameData = {
    bullets_shot: 0,
    time_elapsed: 0,
    enemy_score_spawned: 0,
    enemies_killed: 0,
    waves_cleared: 0
};

const payload = { score, gameData };

try {
    const res = await fetch("../php/end_game.php", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(payload),
    });

    const resData = await res.json();
    console.log(resData);
} catch (err) {
    console.error("Error submitting game data:", err);
}
