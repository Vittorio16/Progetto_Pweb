Controllare se poter accedere alla guida senza aver fatto login Ã¨ un problema
Tell player that faster ufos are worth more
Check if handlers are all right with content maybe not loaded
Add waves to statistics
Add invulnerability animation
Fix schermo che scorre con spacebar
Check what happens when screen shrinks vertically
Collisions should use dynamic widths

It seems to handle multiple games at the same time by the same player well -- make session unique per user across different browsers
High score doesn't update if a game is finished in another tab
Can still always cheat by simulating a whole game
Could cheat by stopping collision check on player
Can't really check game_start and game_end, might not have loaded yet
Could cheat by spawning infinite drops or ufos
Still ways to cheat, especially if slightly

Fatto:
If power up already present of the same time, prolong duration
Add drops to make modifiers for the ship
Fix collisions with drops
