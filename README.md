## What is Space Invaders?
Space Invaders is one of the earliest and most iconic shooting games.  
In this version, you move a cannon left and right along the bottom of the screen and fire upward at alien swarms. The invaders descend gradually, speeding up as their numbers decrease, while you dodge enemy projectiles and protect yourself using barriers.  

The game ends if the aliens reach the bottom or if you lose all your lives.
